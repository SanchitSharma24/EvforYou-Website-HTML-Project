            <p class="subsectag textsmall">An EV is defined as a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source.</p>

            <p class="sectag textbig">HOW DOES A EV CARS WORK?</p>
            <p class="subsectag textsmall">All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank.</p>

            <p class="sectag textbig">Lower running costs</p>
            <p class="subsectag textsmall">Since you are not paying for petrol or diesel to keep your EV running, you save a lot of money on fuel. The cost to charge an electric vehicle compared to the price of petrol or diesel is substantially low. You can reduce the electricity cost further by utilising renewable energy sources such as solar.</p>

            <p class="sectag textbig">Low maintenance costs</p>
            <p class="subsectag textsmall">Petrol or diesel-powered vehicles require regular maintenance since they have multiple moving parts. That’s not the case with electric vehicles since they have comparatively lesser moving parts. This means that your electric car is likely to have lower maintenance costs in the long run.</p>

            <p class="sectag textbig">No fuel, no emissions</p>
            <p class="subsectag textsmall">One of the most significant advantages of EVs is their impact on our environment. Pure EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, which reduces air pollution. Since the electric motor of the EV operates on a closed circuit, it does not emit any harmful gases. Pure electric cars do not require petrol or diesel, which is excellent for the environment.</p>

            <p class="subsectag textsmall">With lesser moving parts and uncomplicated controls, EVs are easy to drive. Also, you can plug such a vehicle into a public or home charging station when you want to charge it. They are also quiet, thereby reducing the sound levels that fuel-powered vehicles generate.</p>

            <p class="subsectag textsmall">There is no need to find the nearest petrol station to fill fuel. Charge your EV at home and get moving. With new-age charging technology, you can charge an EV quickly or even take advantage of battery swapping services to keep driving without worrying about the availability of conventional fuel.</p>
